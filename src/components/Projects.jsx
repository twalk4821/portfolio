    As a cross-platform developer, I worked on both the iOS and Android versions of this app.
    I worked extensively on the native store, as well as on a cross-platform server called

    description: `This is the first app I worked on as a full-time developer. At Wells Fargo, Working on the
    Android adaptation of the existing iOS Greenhouse app, I got to be exclusively in-charge of 
    the implementation of key features of the application. Primarly, I owned the "Shuffle" feature of
    the app, which showcases rows of sliders (SeekBars) enabling users to intuitively shuffle money
    around to various partitions. I designed the implementation to be "reactive" by employing Android's
    LiveData and Data-Binding APIs.`,

    description: `This app began from my passion for Japanese. I wanted a simple application which could 
    scan an image of a character, and be able to identify the character and provide its readings and translations.
    I have coursework in machine learning, so I was able to design a convolutional neural network with Tensorflow, 
    and then convert the model to a more portable size using TensorFlow Lite. The app features black or white writing detection, and
    accurately classifies over 2000 characters with 90% accuracy. It is available as a free download on the Google Play Store.

    description: `I worked as a freelancer with full ownership of the Android implementation of this app. 
    I took the project because I believed the idea to be quite ingenious: you answer questions about the given tv show
    or sporting event before it happens, making predictions about what you believe will happen, and are awarded payouts 
    based on correct predictions. For this app I followed an architectural strategy of MVP, with Retrofit as the HTTP client
    and invoking callbacks to update the UI. It is a Kotlin app, and I also employed Constraint Layout for most screens as well as some RxJava
    for managing asynchronous subscriptions.`,
